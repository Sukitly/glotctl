title: Untranslated Values
description: Understanding untranslated value detection
---

Glot detects translation values in non-primary locales that are identical to the primary locale, which may indicate they haven't been translated yet.

## What Are Untranslated Values?

An untranslated value occurs when:

1. A key exists in both the primary locale and a non-primary locale
2. The value in the non-primary locale is **identical** to the primary locale

This typically happens when:

- Locale files are copy-pasted and translations are forgotten
- A new key is added to all locales but only translated in the primary locale
- Translations are incomplete or rushed

## Example

Primary locale file:

```json messages/en.json
{
  "common": {
    "submit": "Submit",
    "cancel": "Cancel"
  }
}
```

Non-primary locale with untranslated values:

```json messages/zh.json
{
  "common": {
    "submit": "Submit",
    "cancel": "Cancel"
  }
}
```

Glot output:

```
warning: "Common.submit"  untranslated
  --> ./messages/zh.json:3:0
  = note: "Submit"
  = hint: Value is identical to primary locale (en), possibly not translated

warning: "Common.cancel"  untranslated
  --> ./messages/zh.json:4:0
  = note: "Cancel"
  = hint: Value is identical to primary locale (en), possibly not translated

0 errors, 2 warnings
```

## Detection Rules

Glot applies these rules when detecting untranslated values:

### Only Non-Primary Locales Are Checked

The primary locale (defined in `.glotrc.json`) is skipped since it's the source of truth:

```json .glotrc.json
{
  "primaryLocale": "en"
}
```

With this config, `messages/en.json` is never checked for untranslated values.

### Values Must Contain Alphabetic Characters

Pure numbers and symbols are skipped since they're often legitimately the same across locales:

```json
{
  "common": {
    "year": "2024",
    "separator": "---",
    "currency": "$"
  }
}
```

These won't be flagged even if identical across locales.

### Exact Match Required

Only values that are **exactly identical** to the primary locale are flagged:

```json messages/en.json
{
  "common": {
    "greeting": "Hello"
  }
}
```

```json messages/de.json
{
  "common": {
    "greeting": "Hello"
  }
}
```

This would be flagged. But if the German value was "hello" (lowercase), it would not be flagged.

## Severity

Untranslated values are reported as **warnings** (not errors) because:

- Some values legitimately remain the same across languages (brand names, technical terms, etc.)
- They don't break functionality
- They're informational and may not require action

## Running Untranslated Detection

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
  <Tab title="npm">```bash npx glot check untranslated ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">```bash pnpm exec glot check untranslated ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">```bash yarn glot check untranslated ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">```bash bunx glot check untranslated ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

Or run all checks including untranslated:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
  <Tab title="npm">```bash npx glot check ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">```bash pnpm exec glot check ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">```bash yarn glot check ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="bun">```bash bunx glot check ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Fixing Untranslated Values

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run Check">
    <Tabs syncKey="pkg">
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npx glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm exec glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="bun">
        ```bash
        bunx glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Issues">
    For each flagged key, determine if it needs translation or should remain the same.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate Values">
    Update the non-primary locale files with proper translations:
    ```json messages/zh.json
    {
      "common": {
        "submit": "提交",
        "cancel": "取消"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Run the check again to confirm translations are applied:
    <Tabs syncKey="pkg">
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npx glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm exec glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="bun">
        ```bash
        bunx glot check untranslated
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scenarios

### Legitimate Same Values

Some values should remain identical across locales:

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "tagline": "JavaScript"
  }
}
```

In these cases, you can safely ignore the warning.

### Partial Translations

When adding new features, it's common to copy keys from the primary locale and forget to translate some:

```json messages/ja.json
{
  "newFeature": {
    "title": "New Feature",
    "description": "Check out our new feature"
  }
}
```

These should be translated to Japanese.

### Placeholder Text

Sometimes developers use English placeholder text intending to translate later:

```json messages/fr.json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "welcome": "Welcome back!"
  }
}
```

The untranslated check helps catch these before they reach production.
