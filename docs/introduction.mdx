---

Glot is a fast Rust-based CLI tool for checking internationalization (i18n) issues in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects using [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/). It helps you catch hardcoded text that should use translation functions, find missing translation keys, and identify unused translations.

## Scope

Glot is designed specifically for **Next.js** projects using **[next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/)** as the i18n library. It is not a general-purpose i18n linter.

**Supported:**
- Next.js App Router and Pages Router
- next-intl's `useTranslations`, `getTranslations`, `t()`, `t.rich()`, `t.raw()`, `t.markup()`
- TSX/JSX files with `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.js` extensions
- JSON-based locale files

**Not supported:**
- Other frameworks (Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.)
- Other i18n libraries (react-intl, i18next, lingui, etc.)
- Non-JSON translation formats (YAML, PO, XLIFF, etc.)

<Tip>
If your project doesn't use next-intl, glot's hardcoded text detection still works — but translation key analysis (missing, unused, orphan, etc.) requires next-intl patterns.
</Tip>

## Why Glot?

- **Fast**: Built in Rust using the same parser as Next.js (swc)
- **Accurate**: Understands JSX/TSX syntax and next-intl patterns
- **Configurable**: Customize detection rules, ignored patterns, and checked attributes
- **CI-friendly**: Perfect for automated pipelines with exit codes and structured output

## How It Works

Glot parses your TSX/JSX files using the [swc](https://swc.rs/) AST parser (the same parser used by Next.js) and performs static analysis to detect hardcoded text, track translation function usage, and resolve dynamic keys.

For a detailed breakdown of all supported patterns, detection capabilities, and known limitations, see [How Detection Works](/how-it-works).

## Quick Example

```bash
# Check your project for i18n issues
npx glot check

# Output:
# error: "Submit"  hardcoded-text
#   --> ./src/components/Button.tsx:5:22
#   |
# 5 |     return <button>Submit</button>;
#   |                    ^
#
# ✘ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
```
