---

The **glot-i18n** skill is an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/) that teaches code agents the recommended workflow for fixing i18n issues in Next.js + next-intl projects.

## What is an Agent Skill?

Agent Skills are a lightweight, open format for extending code agent capabilities. A skill provides instructions that guide agents through complex tasks step by step.

Unlike MCP tools which give agents direct access to functions, skills teach agents **how** to approach a problem using clear instructions and best practices.

## Installation

### Option 1: Copy to Your Project

Copy the `glot-i18n` skill folder to your project:

```bash
# From the glot repository
cp -r .skills/glot-i18n /path/to/your/project/.skills/
```

Or create a `.skills/glot-i18n/` directory in your project and copy the `SKILL.md` file.

### Option 2: Reference from glot

If your agent supports loading skills from installed packages, the skill is available in the glotctl package:

```
node_modules/glotctl/.skills/glot-i18n/
```

## Prerequisites

The skill requires:

1. **glot MCP server** - Must be configured and available (see [MCP Setup](/agents/mcp))
2. **Project configuration** - A `.glotrc.json` file (run `glot init` if missing)
3. **next-intl** - Your project should use next-intl for translations

## How It Works

When you ask a code agent to fix i18n issues, the skill guides it through this workflow:

```
1. scan_overview     → Understand the scope of issues
2. Fix hardcoded    → Replace text with t() calls
3. Fix primary_missing → Add keys to primary locale
4. Fix replica_lag   → Sync to other locales
```

<Note>
The skill emphasizes following this order because fixing hardcoded issues may create new primary_missing issues, and fixing those may create replica_lag issues.
</Note>

## What the Skill Teaches

### Key Naming Conventions

The skill teaches agents to use structured key names:

```
<area>.<section>.<element>
```

Examples:
- `common.buttons.submit` - Shared UI elements
- `auth.login.title` - Authentication pages  
- `errors.validation.required` - Error messages

### Code Transformation Patterns

The skill provides patterns for common transformations:

**JSX Text:**
```tsx
// Before
<button>Submit</button>

// After
<button>{t("common.submit")}</button>
```

**Attributes:**
```tsx
// Before
<input placeholder="Enter email" />

// After
<input placeholder={t("auth.emailPlaceholder")} />
```

### Best Practices

The skill guides agents to:

- Work in batches of 10-20 issues at a time
- Re-scan after fixes to verify progress
- Ensure `useTranslations` hook is imported
- Handle pagination for large result sets
- Preserve existing code style

## Skill Contents

The skill includes two files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Main instructions (~350 lines) |
| `references/EXAMPLES.md` | Detailed code examples (~250 lines) |

## Example Prompts

Once the skill is installed, try these prompts:

```
"Use glot to fix all hardcoded text in this project"
```

```
"Check for i18n issues and fix them following the glot workflow"
```

```
"Add translations for the new signup form"
```

## Supported Agents

Agent Skills are supported by:

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Gemini CLI
- VS Code (with compatible extensions)
- And [other compatible agents](https://agentskills.io/)

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not being loaded

Ensure the skill is in a `.skills/` directory in your project root or in a location your agent searches.

### Agent not following the workflow

Make sure:
1. The glot MCP server is configured and running
2. The project has a valid `.glotrc.json`
3. Your agent supports Agent Skills
