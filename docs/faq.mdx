## General

<Accordion title="Does glot work with i18next / react-intl / other i18n libraries?">

**No.** Glot is designed specifically for [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/). Translation key analysis (missing, unused, orphan, replica-lag, etc.) relies on next-intl's `useTranslations` and `getTranslations` patterns.

However, **hardcoded text detection** works regardless of your i18n library — it simply finds text in JSX/TSX that isn't wrapped in a translation function.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does glot work with Vue, Angular, or Svelte?">

**No.** Glot only parses JSX/TSX files and is built for Next.js projects. It uses swc (the same parser Next.js uses) to parse your source code.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does glot support YAML, PO, or XLIFF translation files?">

**No.** Glot only supports JSON locale files (e.g., `messages/en.json`). This is the format used by next-intl.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use glot in a monorepo?">

Yes. Set `sourceRoot` and `messagesRoot` to point to the correct locations:

```json .glotrc.json
{
  "primaryLocale": "en",
  "messagesRoot": "./packages/i18n/messages",
  "includes": [
    "apps/web/src/app/[locale]",
    "apps/web/src/components",
    "packages/ui/src"
  ]
}
```

See [Common Configurations](/configuration#common-configurations) for more examples.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does glot modify my source code?">

Only two commands modify files, and both require explicit `--apply` flags:

- `glot baseline --apply` — inserts `// glot-disable-next-line` comments
- `glot fix --apply` — inserts `/* glot-message-keys */` comments
- `glot clean --apply` — removes unused keys from JSON locale files

Without `--apply`, these commands only show a preview (dry run). All other commands (`check`, `init`, `serve`) are read-only.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How fast is glot?">

Glot is built in Rust and uses swc for parsing, making it very fast. Typical performance:

- **Small projects** (~50 files): under 1 second
- **Medium projects** (~500 files): 1–3 seconds
- **Large projects** (~2000+ files): 3–10 seconds

Performance depends on the number of files scanned and locale file sizes. You can limit what's scanned via the `includes` and `ignores` configuration options.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What versions of Next.js and next-intl are supported?">

Glot works with any version of **Next.js** (App Router and Pages Router) and any version of **next-intl**, as long as your project follows the standard patterns:

- `useTranslations` / `getTranslations` for obtaining translation functions
- JSON-based locale files (e.g., `messages/en.json`)

Glot analyzes source code statically — it doesn't import or execute your project, so there are no runtime version constraints.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does glot work on Windows, macOS, and Linux?">

**Yes.** Glot is distributed as a pre-compiled npm package with binaries for:

- macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- Linux (x64 and ARM64)
- Windows (x64)

If you install via `npm install -D glotctl`, the correct binary is selected automatically.

</Accordion>

## Detection Issues

<Accordion title="Why is some text not being detected?">

Common reasons:

1. **File not in `includes` paths** — glot only scans directories listed in your `.glotrc.json` `includes` config. Check that the file's directory is included.

2. **File is a test file** — by default, `ignoreTestFiles` is `true`, which skips `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, and `__tests__/` files.

3. **Text has no alphabetic characters** — glot only flags text containing at least one Unicode alphabetic character. Pure numbers (`123`) and symbols (`---`, `$100`) are ignored.

4. **Suppressed by directive** — check if there's a `glot-disable-next-line` or `glot-disable` comment above the text.

5. **Attribute not in `checkedAttributes`** — only attributes listed in `checkedAttributes` are checked. Custom attributes like `label` or `description` are not checked by default.

6. **Text matches `ignoreTexts` pattern** — check your `.glotrc.json` for ignored text patterns.

Run with `-v` (verbose) to see which files are being scanned:

```bash
npx glot check -v
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'm getting false positives — how do I suppress them?">

Several options, from most to least specific:

1. **Single line**: Add `// glot-disable-next-line` (or `{/* glot-disable-next-line */}` in JSX) above the line.

2. **Block**: Wrap with `// glot-disable` and `// glot-enable`.

3. **Specific text patterns**: Add to `ignoreTexts` in `.glotrc.json`:
   ```json
   { "ignoreTexts": ["TODO", "N/A", "Lorem ipsum"] }
   ```

4. **Entire file**: Place `// glot-disable` on line 1 or 2.

5. **Entire directory**: Add the path to `ignores` in `.glotrc.json`.

See [Directives](/directives) for details.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Why does "glot clean" refuse to run?'>

`glot clean` refuses to run when your code has **unresolved dynamic keys** — translation keys that use variables or template literals that glot can't statically analyze:

```tsx
// glot can't know which keys this uses
t(`status.${code}`)
```

This is a safety feature to prevent accidentally deleting keys that are used dynamically.

**Fix**: Declare your dynamic keys with `glot-message-keys` annotations:

```tsx
// glot-message-keys "status.active", "status.inactive", "status.pending"
t(`status.${code}`)
```

Or use the `fix` command to auto-insert them:

```bash
npx glot fix --apply
```

Then `glot clean` will run safely.

See [Unresolved Keys](/detection/unresolved-keys) and [glot fix](/commands/fix) for details.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are brand names / technical terms flagged?">

Glot flags any text containing alphabetic characters. Brand names like "Google" or technical terms like "TypeScript" will be flagged.

Suppress them per-line:

```tsx
{/* glot-disable-next-line */}
<span>Acme Corporation</span>
```

Or globally via `ignoreTexts`:

```json
{ "ignoreTexts": ["Acme Corporation", "TypeScript"] }
```

</Accordion>

## Configuration Issues

<Accordion title='Glot says "Directory does not exist" for my includes path'>

Glot validates that directories in `includes` exist. Common causes:

1. **Wrong relative path** — paths in `includes` are relative to `sourceRoot`. If `sourceRoot` is `"./src"` and you have `"includes": ["app"]`, glot looks for `./src/app`.

2. **Dynamic route syntax** — `[locale]` is treated as a literal folder name. Make sure the folder `[locale]` actually exists on disk.

3. **Missing directory** — the directory may not exist in your project. Update `includes` to match your actual structure.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where should I place .glotrc.json?">

Place it in your **project root** (next to `package.json`). Glot searches upward from the current directory until it finds `.glotrc.json` or a `.git` directory.

See [Configuration Resolution](/configuration#configuration-resolution) for the full search algorithm.

</Accordion>

## CI / Integration Issues

<Accordion title="What exit codes does glot use?">

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | No errors (warnings may exist) |
| 1 | Errors found |

**Errors** (exit code 1): hardcoded text, missing keys, type mismatches.

**Warnings** (exit code 0): orphan keys, untranslated values, unused keys, replica-lag, unresolved keys.

This means `glot check` in CI will only fail the build on actual errors, not warnings.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I adopt glot in a project with many existing issues?">

Use the **baseline** workflow:

1. Run `npx glot baseline --apply` to suppress all existing hardcoded text warnings
2. Add `glot check` to CI — new issues will be caught immediately
3. Gradually fix existing issues and remove suppression comments over time

See [Baseline Command](/commands/baseline) for details.
